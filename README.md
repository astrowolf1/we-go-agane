# We Go Agane
AutoHotkey script for quickly resetting Minecraft Worlds

### Latest Download: [v1.1](https://github.com/digilog-d/we-go-agane/releases)

## Instructions
1. Download and open the .zip file. Drag the .exe file to a folder of your choosing and double-click it.
2. The first time you run the program, Windows may warn you that it is unrecognized. This is because you've downloaded it from the internet and it's not digitally signed (which would cost me a fortune), so just hit ```More info``` then ```Run Anyway```
3. Choose your options and hit ```Start```. The window will disappear, but it is running in the background.
4. Make sure Minecraft is NOT in fullscreen mode.
5. (Optional) Hit the ```Toggle Borderless Fullscreen``` hotkey, by default ```F7```. Minecraft should now be fullscreen.
7. Hit the reset hotkey to reset at any time. If you have no worlds in your saves folder, you may need to create one first.
8. If you want to quit the program or change any settings, you can access it in the Windows taskbar tray. (That's the little up arrow in the bottom-right corner of your screen)
9. Your settings are saved, so next time you open the program, you can just hit ```Start```.

## FAQ

### How to reset?
Hit ```F6```.

### But what if I don't like F6?
You can change it easily. Just hit the box that says "Hotkey" and tap your preferred hotkey.

### I have practice worlds in my saves folder. Will this macro delete those?
No, it won't. Just make sure your practice worlds don't have "new world" in their names.

### Does this work in fullscreen?
Unfortunately, it does not work in complete fullscreen mode. However, I have provided a quick and easy way to put Minecraft in Windowed/Borderless Fullscreen mode, which does work. By default, this key is ```F7```, but you can change it. Make sure ```Fullscreen``` is unchecked in Minecraft Video Settings.

### What versions does this program support?
As of now, it supports 1.16 RSG resets, but I'm planning on adding support for 1.8 and 1.14, SSG and RSG. FSG maybe but no promises.

### What are the features?
- Create worlds with any difficulty
- Automatically delete previous worlds
  - You can specify how many previous worlds to keep, or completely disable this feature
- Easy to use. It's just a single .exe file. Just double-click it.
- Reset from anywhere
  - This includes inventories, the pause screen, main menu, and world selection screen in addition to being in-game
  - Does not yet work from the death screen. I kinda forgot about that one.

### Why did you make this?
I originally made this program when Nerdi expressed interest for a macro that automatically deletes old worlds (past the previous 5) so he doesn't need to do a batch delete after streaming. This is my first 'real' script with AHK, but I have many years of experience programming, so I thought I'd give it a shot.

### How long did it take you to make?
It's been in the works for a few weeks, as it was originally just the macro, but I wanted it to have a decent user interface as well.
